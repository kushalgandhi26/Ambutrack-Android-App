# Ambutrack
The key idea behind this application is to aid ambulance drivers in locating the location of the patient easily with the help of GPS navigation in order to minimize wastage of time. 
We aim to resolve the ambiguity of the patient as well as the ambulance, in terms of their respective locations in case of emergency.

This is an android application made using Android Studio and Firebase. 

This project was done as a part of our academic curriculum under the course Design, Innovation and Making. We are students form Ahmedabad University.
